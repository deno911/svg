## Coming Soon

We are excited to announce the upcoming release of **`SVG` for Deno** -- a game-changer for SVG creation, manipulation, and more.

With this project you'll finally be able unlock unlimited creative potential. Create stunning, interactive visuals with Deno, without the need to learn an entirely new API totally foreign to you. Manipulate existing images, parse and optimize on a code-level, and much more. All from a familiar API that's easily integrated with other popular tools in the ecosystem.

Designed to be simple yet powerful, this module will streamline your workflows and make your creations shine.

Stay tuned for the official release in the next few weeks! We're working hard to perfect every aspect, ensuring a smooth and delightful experience. Follow our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deno911/svg) for updates.
